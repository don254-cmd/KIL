    <p>Welcome to Zoom Tech. These Terms and Conditions serve as a legally binding agreement between you (the user) and Zoom Tech (the provider). Our website provides an e-commerce platform for the sale of mobile phone parts, GSM tools, electronics, software activation services, and other related technology products.

Zoom Tech reserves the right to update or change these terms without prior notice. Continued use of the website after any modifications constitutes acceptance of the revised terms.</p>

    <h2>2. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>All content available on the Zoom Tech website, including text, images, product descriptions, logos, graphics, and code, is the intellectual property of Zoom Tech or its licensed suppliers. You are granted a limited license only for purposes of viewing the material contained on this website for personal and non-commercial use. You are not permitted to reproduce, distribute, modify, republish, or exploit any content for commercial purposes without explicit written permission from Zoom Tech. Any unauthorized use of our materials may result in legal action and termination of your access to the platform.</p>

    <h2>3. Restrictions</h2>
    <p>As a user of this website, you are expressly prohibited from: publishing any website material in other media, selling or sublicensing website material, publicly performing or displaying any content from the site, or using the website in a way that may cause damage, interfere with access, or breach security. Additionally, you must not use this website to engage in any form of advertising or marketing without prior written approval from Zoom Tech. Misuse or violation of any of these restrictions may result in account suspension and legal enforcement where necessary.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Content</h2>
    <p>You may have the opportunity to post or submit content such as reviews, comments, or inquiries. By doing so, you grant Zoom Tech a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, and distribute your content in connection with promoting or operating the business. You are solely responsible for ensuring that any content you upload does not violate the intellectual property rights or privacy of third parties.
